# Coordinate-Converter
A C# program that converts coordinates from decimal degrees to degrees/minutes/seconds.

- It prompts the user for the input of the latitude as a decimal from +90.00 to -90.00 and then the Longitude from -180.0 to +180.00
- It handles improper coordinates like +91° or - 181° or non-number variables
- Allows the user to quit the program by entering "Q"
